# Data Cleaning, Modelling and Analysis With MS Excel, SQL and Python



## INTRODUCTION

In this project, a popular social media company who were considering doing an IPO wanted an analysis of their top five content categories.  They provided a number of datasets for us to study and drive meaningful insights from. I had to understand the client's requirements and identified the datasets that will be required to answer the client's business question.

I started with cleaning the data and merged them to prepare the data for analysis.

Finally, I used the clean data to answer the client's business question by deriving the top five content categories. I completed the project using three different tools for cleaning, modelling and analysing the data i.e. [MS-Excel](https://github.com/omabogun/Data-Analysis_Projects/blob/main/project-1_details.md), [SQL](https://github.com/omabogun/Data-Analysis_Projects/blob/main/project-2_details.md) and [Python](https://github.com/omabogun/Data-Analysis_Projects/blob/main/project-3_details.md).


## Data Model:

On studying the data model, I realized that only three of the datasets are required to answer the client's question

<OL>
  <li>The Content Table</li> 
  <li>Reaction types Table</li>
  <li>Reaction Table</li>
</OL>

Below are links to how the Datasets were cleaned using three methods:
