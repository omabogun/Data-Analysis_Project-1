# <p align='center'> PROJECT 1: USING MICROSOFT EXCEL <br> TO CLEAN DATA, MODEL DATA AND ANALYZE DATA TO DETERMINE TOP FIVE CONTENT CATEGORY REQUIRED BY THE CLIENT

### The Data Model:

On examining the data model below I realized that only three of the datasets would be required to answer the client's question.

These are:
<ol>
  <li>The Content Table</li>
  <li>The Reaction Table</li>
  <li>The ReactionTypes Table</li>
</ol>

### Cleaning the Datasets

To clean the datasets I started by removing columns which were not needed to answer the business question from each of the tables.  In the content table I removed the USER ID and URL columns.

The content table contained some records with quotation marks (") in the Category column. I had to clean this by removing the quotation marks using the Find and Replace feature in MS Excel.
