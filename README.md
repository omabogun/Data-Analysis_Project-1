# Data-Analysis_Project-1
In this project a popular social media organization who were considering doing an IPO wanted an analysis of their top five content categories.  They provided a number of raw datasets for to be refined and derive meaningful insights from.  I had to understand the requirements of the client and identified which datasets will be required to answer the client's business question.

Then, I had to clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis.  

Finally, I used the cleaned data to answer the client's question by deriving the top five content categories.  I used Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for cleaning, modelling and analyzing the data.
