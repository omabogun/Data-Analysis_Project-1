# <p align='center'>PROJECT 2: USING SQL TO CLEAN DATA, MODEL DATA AND ANALYZE DATA TO GENERATE TOP FIVE CONTENT CATEGORIES FOR A CLIENT


## INTRODUCTION

In this project a popular social media organization who were considering doing an IPO wanted an analysis of their top five content categories. They provided a number of raw datasets for to be refined and derive meaningful insights from. I had to understand the requirements of the client and identified which datasets will be required to answer the client's business question.

Then, I had to clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis.

Finally, I used the cleaned data to answer the client's question by deriving the top five content categories. I used SQL as the primary tool for cleaning, modelling and analyzing the data.

## IMPORTING RAW DATASETS INTO SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO

I started by importing the raw datasets into SQL Server Management Studio
